## Steps to Repair a Delta Faucet Leak  

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the repair process:  

1. **Turn Off the Water Supply**  
   Locate the shut-off valves under the sink and turn them clockwise to stop water flow.  

2. **Remove the Faucet Handle**  
   Use a screwdriver or Allen wrench to detach the handle. Be gentle to avoid scratching the finish.  

3. **Inspect the Cartridge**  
   The cartridge is often the culprit. Check for wear or damage and replace it if necessary.  

4. **Replace O-Rings**  
   Worn O-rings can cause leaks. Remove the spout and replace the O-rings with new ones.  

5. **Reassemble the Faucet**  
   Put the faucet back together, ensuring all components are securely in place.  

6. **Test the Faucet**  
   Turn the water supply back on and check for leaks.  

## Tips for Preventing Future Leaks  

- **Regular Maintenance:** Inspect your faucet periodically for signs of wear.  
- **Avoid Over-Tightening:** Tightening the handle too much can damage internal components.  
- **Use Quality Parts:** Invest in genuine Delta replacement parts for long-lasting results.  

By addressing a leaking Delta faucet promptly, you can save money, conserve water, and maintain the functionality of your plumbing system. If youâ€™re unsure about tackling the repair yourself, hiring a professional plumber in Los Angeles ensures the job is done right the first time.
